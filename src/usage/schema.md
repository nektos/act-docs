# Schema

Did you land here with cryptic errors? Then please install the following official GitHub Actions VSCode Extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions and review all errors/warnings shown there.

Once you are shure this is an error in act, please look for existing issues or report a new issue here https://github.com/nektos/act/issues.

_Act's builtin schema validation errors are not easy to understand while keeping the development effort reasonable for open source_
