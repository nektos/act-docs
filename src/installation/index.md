# Installation

## Necessary prerequisites for running `act`

`act` depends on `docker` (exactly Docker Engine API) to run workflows.

If you are using macOS, please be sure to follow the steps outlined in [Docker Docs for how to install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

If you are using Windows, please follow steps for [installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

If you are using Linux, you will need to [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

To use `act` with remote Docker Engine API compatible host, see [Custom container engine](./../usage/custom_engine.md)
`act` is currently not supported with `podman` or other container backends (it might work, but it's not guaranteed).
Please see [#303](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/303) for updates.
